## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an integral part of the project development process. I follow a rigorous TDD approach to ensure the reliability and correctness of my code. Here's how I implement TDD:

- I start by writing tests that define the expected behavior of the code.
- These tests act as a blueprint for the features or functionality I plan to implement.
- I then write code to make the tests pass while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.
- Continuous testing and refactoring help maintaining a high level of code quality throughout the development process.

The commitment to TDD ensures that my project is robust, well-tested, and ready to meet the expectations of our users. also to meet the requirements of the project
